#### Calculator Testing Project

    Defects in Staging:
        - Number '5' on staging actually types '6' into the calculator.
        - Multiplication by 2 misbehaves as if multiplied by a larger number.
             e.g. 9 * 2 = 20; 4 * 2 = 10 etc.

    To Run:
        - run all tests with "mvn clean install"
